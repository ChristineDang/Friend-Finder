# Friend-Finder

ABOUT:
* Friend Finder is an app that allows users to find a new friend match, based on a 10 question survey.

APP OVERVIEW:
* The app consists of 4 JavaScript pages that hosts the server links and routes, along with 2 html pages - one containing the home page, and the other containing the survey page. Within the survey.html document, holds JavaScript code, which contains the actions for the submit button, saving the user's input, and posting the returned friend match calculation (done on the apiRoutes.js document, within the "app.post" section) through a modal.


HOW TO USE Friend Finder:
1. Open the Heroku hosted link and click on the blue "Go to Survey" button. 

2. Enter in your name, a url link of your profile image you would like to use, then answer the 10 statements.

3. Once completed, click on the blue "Submit" button at the bottom of the page, and a friend match will then show on your screen, through a modal. 

* If you would like to restart the survey, refresh the page and re-do steps two and three.
